Comic Helper makes it easier to read webcomics by including in the page any
secret/easter egg content in hidden panels, alt text, etc, and improving
RSS feeds in Google Reader by including content that isn't served by RSS.

Included in /src is the source for a Google Chrome extension.
/appengine includes the Google App Engine project that handles the scraping of
hidden content data, returning it in JSON

Comic Helper uses the Beautiful Soup Python module, under the BSD license,
